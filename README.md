# Sorting Algorithms Implementation

This repository contains implementations of six common sorting algorithms in C++:

* Bubble Sort
* Insertion Sort
* Selection Sort
* Merge Sort
* Quick Sort (with extra array for partitioning)
* Quick Sort (in-place partitioning)


## Usage

The core functionality is encapsulated in `sort.hpp`.  This file contains the definitions of the six sorting algorithms listed above.  You can integrate this header file into your own projects to utilize these sorting routines.


## Compilation

To compile and test, include `sort.hpp` in your main C++ file, then compile using a C++ compiler.
